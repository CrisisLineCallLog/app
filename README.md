## Crisis Line Call Log app

This is an app created to support volunteers of the crisis line to note their call times. Sorry Apple lovers, it's currently only available for Android devices.

### To Install

There are a few settings we'll need to change before the app can be installed. Go to Settings and choose 'Lock screen and security' then 'Security or Applications' (depending on your device). Check the box for 'Unknown Sources'. This setting allows the app to work. Don’t worry, it won’t harm your phone or tablet.

Download the [.apk file](https://github.com/CrisisLineCallLog/app/raw/main/app-release.apk). This is the crisis line call log app, all wrapped up and ready to be installed!

You may see a warning pop-up: 'This type of file can harm your device. Do you want to keep app-release.apk?' Tap OK to accept and download the file. 

Find the download in your Notifications by sliding down the notifications tray at the top. Wait for the download to finish and tap on it. You may also see an option at the bottom of your current screen to Open the file. You can also tap that.

Almost there. You may see another warning that this app is 'Blocked by Play Protect'. Tap 'Install Anyway'.

BOOM! Done!

When you open the app for the first time, a pop-up will show asking 'Allow Call Log to make and manage phone calls?' Tap 'Allow'. The app does not make or manage phone calls. We use this permission to open the app each time a phone call ends and for nothing else.

You can change your settings back to what they were by going to Settings, choosing 'Lock screen and security' then 'Security and Applications', and unchecking the box for 'Unknown Sources.'

Note: If you don’t see the .apk file in your Notifications tray after downloading, go to your apps and search for either 'My Files' or 'Downloads'. Find app-release.apk and tap on it to install.
