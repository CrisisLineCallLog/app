## Crisis Line Call Log app

This is an app created to support volunteers of the crisis line to note their call times. Sorry Apple lovers, it's currently only available for Android devices.

### To Install

There are a few settings we'll need to change before the app can be installed. Go to Settings and choose 'Lock screen and security', 'Security or Applications' (depending on your device). Then check the box for 'Unknown Sources'. This setting allows the app to work. Don’t worry, it won’t harm your phone or tablet.

Download the [.apk file](https://github.com/CrisisLineCallLog/app/blob/main/app-release.apk). This is the crisis line call log app, all wrapped up and ready to be installed!

Find the download in your Notifications by sliding down the notifications tray at the top, wait for the download to finish and tap on it.

BOOM! Done!

You can change your settings back to what they were by going to Settings, choosing 'Lock screen and security' then 'Security and Applications', and unchecking the box for 'Unknown Sources.'

Note: If you don’t see the .apk in your Notifications tray after downloading, go to your apps and search for either 'My Files' or 'Downloads'. Find app-release.apk and tap on it to install.
